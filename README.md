# Fun with Haskell and Fibonacci Numbers

## The Challenge

A while ago I was experimenting with Haskell, and one of my experiments was the Haskell program that forms this project. Actually I posted it first [here](https://juergenpf.wordpress.com/2019/06/15/fun-with-haskell-and-fibonacci-numbers/) on my Wordpress Blog as a single Haskell file, while this is now a bit more modular to reflect a typical - yet simple - structure of a Haskell project with Visual Studio Code.

The first thing you notice when you calculate the Fibonacci series in modulo arithmetic (with a prime modulus) is, that the generated series is periodic. For example, 

> __the Fibonacci series modulo 3 is [0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,..]__,  

which means it is a repetition of the finite list __[0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1]__.  

I define the __FibonacciPeriod__ of a prime p as the length of this finite list generating the Fibonacci series modulo p. So for p=3 we have

> __FibonacciPeriod 3 = 8__

What you also can see in the experiment is, that the FibonacciPeriod of p has usually a large GCD with one of p-1 or p+1. I call this GCD the __FibonacciModulus__ of a prime p. For example, we have

> __FibonacciModulus 3 = 4__

Apparently, the FibonacciModulus being a divisor of the FibonacciPeriod, we can define for a prime p 

> __FibonacciWeight__ p = FibonacciPeriod(p) / FibonacciModulus(p).

Which for example gives

> __FibonacciWeight 3 = 2__

A surprising role in the experiments takes the prime 5. For 5 you get an unusual long period of Fibonacci numbers, actually all other primes in the experiment have periods smaller than the prime, or approx. the size of the prime or twice the size of the prime, which results in all primes except 5 have a FibonacciWeight of 1 or 2, only 5 has the FibonacciWeight 5. 

This gives motivation to these conjectures:

1. __The Fibonacci series modulo a prime is a periodic series__
1. __The FibonacciWeight of a prime is always 1 or 2, except for p=5 where it is 5__

This makes __5__ looking even more magic when it comes to Fibonacci numbers, because for the classical Fibonacci series the ratio f(n+1)/f(n) converges to (1+sqrt(5))/2, a well know and simple to proof fact, where the 5 also comes in magically.
 
Actually, there is mathimatical proof for these conjectures.
See:  [Fibonacci-Zahlen, Â© Michael Becker](assets/Fibonacci-Zahlen.pdf) (in German. This is a paper that was on the web for quite a while, but the author has cleaned up his [Homepage](http://www.ijon.de/), so I'm hosting a copy here).

## The Haskell environment I use

As good as Haskell as a language is, the support for easy to use free development environments was a challenge for a long time, but the situation dramatically improved. Casual users or beginners want to have more guidance by a good (visual) tooling, and this is now available thanks to the integration of Haskell into the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor, using the machinery provided by the [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) project.

It looks like some Haskell professionals took the challenge and are working to improve the situation. In recent years we saw the rise of very generic graphical editor environments like Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime etc - and there are tons of extensions for various of the most popular and even rare languages. This makes them an interesting target to build some Haskell tooling.

### The Operating System

I'm as much a Linux as a Windows guy, so no religious dispute here. They both have their merits and both are excellent Operating Systems. But when it comes to Haskell, you're much better off by using Linux as your environment. Yes, Haskell is available on Windows, but if you try to build complex packages you ofteh run into challenges that require manual tweaks, as the primary environment of the authors was most certainly Linux.
So I decided to make use of the best of both worlds, which means

1. Windows 11 Pro (started with Windows 10) with [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index). The __W__indows __S__ubsystem for __L__inux Version 2 relies on the 2004 Update (means April 2020) of Windows 10 or of course a more recent update or Windows 11, providing a Linux Kernel in addition to the Windows Kernel. This allows to run Linux distributions on a Windows system without a need to setup virtual machines.
1. [Ubuntu-24.04 LTS for WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9nz3klhxdjp5?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). This is a user space Ubuntu-24.04 distribution that runs with the Linux Kernel provided by Windows 10/11 WSL2. In this distribution I then install the regular Haskell tooling using the [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) tool. BTW, when I started this project, I was using Ubuntu-22.04 for WSL2, so that works too.

### The Editor

I decided to go with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (no surprise as I'm a retired Microsoftie:-)). Please note, that you should not install this editor in the WSL2 Linux you use, but on the Windows host. The reason is, that for WSL2 the editor provides a special remote extension, that allows to run the editor as Windows app but doing the build in the WSL2 subsystem (see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl))

### The Haskell Tooling

First of all, the setup of the Haskell toolchain has been much simplified by the [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) project, which intends to provide a developer oriented personal setup of the required tooling, like some other modern languages do, e.g. rustup for rust. Don't use the package manager for your preferred Linux to install the tooling, the quality of what you get varies too much from distro to distro and is not predictable. And you don't need admin privileges to install the toolchain, it's all kept private. So - while in the WSL2 shell - just follow the instructions from the [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) Website to install the Haskell compiler and tools like cabal, stack and HLS (the Haskell Lanhuage Server)

In Visual Studio Code I use the excellent [Haskell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) extension. This is now a very mature environment which includes and is based on the [Haskell Language Server]( https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server).

The Haskell Language Server is a merger of the previos separate projects [Haskell IDE Engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) and [ghcide](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide). The server provides all the binaries required by the Visual Studio Code extension.

The result is a basic tooling that allows very nice syntax highlighting, code completion, code navigation, support for displaying Documentation annotations etc.

It's worth mentioning that [the Haskell Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) is a brilliant starter for the basic code navigation. But I would like to see features from the [Haskelly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=UCL.haskelly) extionsion beeing provided too in the future, especially the ones that automatically discover which buttons may be usefull in the current context and displays these buttons in the status bar. This then provides the very basic feeling of a visual development environment: Edit code and the simply click a button to build, test or run!

P.S.: I tried to run the above sample not only on Windows, but also on native Linux, MacOS (on Apple Silicon) and even on a Raspberry Pi 4 with the 64Bit Version of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)-24.04 64Bit. The tooling for the aarch64 architecture on these platforms is provided by [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). Finally I had VSCode with the Haskell Extension up and running on the aarch64 based Raspberry and MacOS and the sample compiled and executed fine on all these platforms.
